Exercise from a quiklab called introduction to Github

I am editing the README file. Adding some more details about the project description.

Exercise to auto-close an issue when either:

commit message references the issue like `closes: #1`
or pull description includes `closes: #1`
then when merged, the issue will automatically close.
